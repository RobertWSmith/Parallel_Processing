% Lab 3: Pthreads & Floyd's Algorithm
% \today




To begin my familiarity with Floyd's Algorithm, I investigated the serial implementation of the algorithm and confirmed its effectiveness as a means to compare the parallel version.

Upon the investigation of the whole of the data, and an ANOVA experiment, it seems that there is a significant difference in the amount of time that it takes for Floyd's Algorithm to evaluate a 28x28 matrix and the number of threads involved in the experiment. Based on further analysis with Tukey's HSD test it seems that there is no significant difference between 4 and 2 threads on my machine (Intel Core i5 laptop 1.7 ghz), but there is a significant difference between 2 & 7 threads and 4 & 7 threads. 

Based on this, and the knowledge that my laptop is dual-core with hyperthreading which allows a maximum of 4 simultaneous threads I'd follow this up with an experiment to confirm that the maximum amount of simultaneous threads allow for the fastest execution of a pthreads program on a given machine.
